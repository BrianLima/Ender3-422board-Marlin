# Ender3-422board-Marlin
My Marlin configuration file for a Ender 3 with 4.2.2 board and some features i think are usefull

## Enabled features:
- NOZZLE_PARK_FEATURE
- ADVANCED_PAUSE_FEATURE
- SPEAKER
- ENCODER_NOISE_FILTER
Most of the other features and configurations are taken from the base Marlin Creality 4.2.2 example configuration.
